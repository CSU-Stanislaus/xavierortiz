 Exam1_PreparationGuide.java
 --------------------------------
 A simple guide for students to prepare for Exam 1 — formatted as Java comments
 so you can drop this file into a project and open it in your IDE.

 The exam will be given in a job-interview style, but the questions below are
 slightly easier / more introductory to help you prepare.

 Read each question and practice explaining the answer out loud and with small
 code examples where appropriate.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 10 EASY INTERVIEW-STYLE QUESTIONS — INTRODUCTION TO JAVA
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1) Tell me briefly: how did you start learning Java and what is one small
    Java program or project you have written?

 2) What is the JVM? What does it do in one sentence?

 3) What does the 'javac' command do? What does the 'java' command do?
    (Just one short line for each is fine.)

 4) What is a class? What is an object? Give a very short example in words
    (e.g., "class = Dog, object = myDog").

 5) Name two basic benefits of using classes (hint: think about organization
    and re-use).

 6) What is the difference between '==' and '.equals()' when comparing Strings?
    Give the expected output for this example:
        String a = "hi";
        String b = "hi";
        System.out.println(a == b);
        System.out.println(a.equals(b));

 7) What is the difference between a primitive type (like int) and its wrapper
    class (like Integer)? Give one situation when you would use Integer instead
    of int.

 8) What is the special method the JVM looks for to start a Java program?
    Write its full signature exactly as the JVM expects it.

 9) What will this small program print? Explain in one short sentence why.
        public class Example {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                String s = null;
                System.out.println(s == null);
            }
        }

 10) If you see a NullPointerException, what is one quick check you should do?
     Give one coding practice to reduce the chance of seeing it again.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 BONUS (optional):
    In one sentence, how does Java allow the same program to run on Windows
    and Linux without changing the source code? (Hint: think bytecode and the JVM)

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STUDY TIPS (short)
 - Practice saying answers out loud as if you were in an interview.
 - Type small code snippets in your IDE to confirm behavior.
 - Focus on short, clear explanations and one simple example per answer.
 - Time yourself: give short answers (~30–90 seconds) like in an interview.

 Good luck — practice clearly and simply. ☕
